# QR Nodes

Node-based editor for QR codes

# Bugs

- In ff, sometimes dragging quickly or triple click triggers HTML drag "ghost"
  - `draggable="false"` doesn't work in ff
  - If I had a nickel for each time I found an obscure 13 year old bug in FF, I'd have like 10 nickels which is a lot.

# Enhancements

- Selectable area around node should scale with zoom
  - Currently, no safe margin at all so harder to select when zoomed out
